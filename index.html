                    Being a developer means creating your own solutions, new ideas, and new problems. Even locked into a 
                    specific goal, there are many ways to achieve the end result. This freedom to express your own ideas through code 
                    is a very attractive quality in a job to keep you engaged in your work.

                    Development is something you are able to do anywhere with a computer and internet connection, so pretty much anywhere!
                    This goes two ways - you can <strong>live anywhere</strong> and you can take <em>any job</em>, making travel much easier.
                    Visiting family, exploring new places, even traveling the world are possible!

                    Developement isn't just a well paying job, but a flexible one with a large market.
                    There is no worry of running out of work because something is always being made;
                    if something isn't being made - make something! Development can be self-employment as well as a traditional job.
